Sometimes the ticket costs only 10 soles, and other times it's completely free! The seats are incredibly comfortable, making for an enjoyable viewing experience. Additionally, you have the option to donate money to help support the cinema and ensure its continued stability",

                "One of the few theaters in Arequipa that I can say promotes art, doing workshops for young people and adults, improvisation workshops, screenings of very interesting films, and obviously plays. It's my favorite place in my free time. Recommended",
                "Good space dedicated to cultural dissemination, with a gallery, movie theater, and workshops. It is located in a beautiful country house near the main square. The space is cozy, I went through the exhibition of illustrations inspired by well-known films, and I attended the screening of a Peruvian documentary."

Apart from the fact that they have a salad buffet, something that is no longer found in many chicken shops in Aqp. ...Their sauces have a very special touch that makes the chicken tastier...TMB the prices are very good and affordable...And there are offers that make you want to try....It became one of my favorite points\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70"
